	<h1>Augustus Odena</h1>
	<p>
    I'm a computer scientist working on Machine Learning.
    A lot of my research has been on
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">Generative Adversarial Networks</a>, though I have
    also worked on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning">Semi-Supervised Learning</a>
    and other, miscellaneous topics.
    Recently, I've been more focused on problems at the intersection of Machine Learning and Computer Systems (e.g.
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10875">Coverage-Guided Fuzzing of Neural Networks</a>).
  </p>
	<p>
    Currently I'm a Research Scientist on the
    <a href="https://ai.google/research/teams/brain">Brain Team</a> at Google, where I used to work in 
    <a href="http://www.iangoodfellow.com/">Ian Goodfellow's</a> group and now work in 
    <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/">Charles Sutton's</a> group.
    I was in the first batch of <a href="https://ai.google/research/join-us/ai-residency/">Google Brain Residents</a>, 
    before which I worked at a startup called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervana_Systems">Nervana Systems</a>.
  </p>
	<p>
    Before all of that, I was a trader: I worked at <a href="https://fiverings.com/">this proprietary trading firm</a>
    and <a href="https://www.mlp.com/home/">this hedge fund</a>.
    Before I was a trader, I was a Math major at
    <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>.
